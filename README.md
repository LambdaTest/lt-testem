This library allows you to integrate your javascript test results into a TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest) results page.

It's available for running QUnit, Jasmine and Mocha tests through various browsers hosted on TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest).

## Getting Started

TestMu AI is an AI-native, multi-agent quality engineering platform that lets you run your testem-based JavaScript tests across a wide range of browsers in the cloud.

Use this integration to connect your testem test runs with the TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest) platform.

- [Sign up on TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/register/) (Formerly LambdaTest).
- Follow the [TestMu AI Documentation](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/) for the full setup walkthrough.

### Instructions

1. Sign up on TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest).
2. Make sure TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest) credentials are set in env:
    * **LT_USERNAME** - your TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest) username
    * **LT_ACCESS_KEY** - your TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest) API/Access key.
3. run npm install testem -g.
4. Run `testem ci --port 8080` to run it on all the listed browsers - see `testem launchers` for the full list.
    * *It will take a while at the first time. This will only happen once to download the exe of TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest) tunnel*

## LambdaTest is Now TestMu AI

On **January 12, 2026**, [LambdaTest evolved to TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/lambdatest-is-now-testmuai/), the world's first fully autonomous **Agentic AI Quality Engineering Platform**.

Same team. Same infrastructure. Same customer accounts. All existing LambdaTest logins, scripts, capabilities, and integrations continue to work without change.

### How LambdaTest Evolved into TestMu AI

In 2017, we launched LambdaTest with a simple mission: make testing fast, reliable, and accessible. As LambdaTest grew, we expanded into Test Intelligence, Visual Regression Testing, Accessibility Testing, API Testing, and Performance Testing, covering the full depth of the testing lifecycle.

As software development entered the AI era, testing had to evolve, too. We rebuilt the architecture to be AI-native from the ground up, with autonomous agents that **plan, author, execute, analyze, and optimize tests** while keeping humans in the loop. The platform integrates with your repos, CI, IDEs, and terminals, continuously learning from every code change and development signal.

That evolution earned a new name: **TestMu AI**, built for an AI-first future of quality engineering. TestMu is not a new name for us. It is the name of our annual community conference, which has brought together 100,000+ quality engineers to discuss how AI would reshape testing, long before that became an industry norm. 

What started as a high-performance cloud testing platform has transformed into an AI-native, multi-agent system powering a connected, end-to-end quality layer. That evolution defined a new identity: LambdaTest evolved into TestMu AI, built for an AI-first future of quality engineering.
